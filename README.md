# DevTest
Technical Test - .NET Developer (Data Import)    Overview Read the assignment carefully before starting with implementation. The goal of this test             is to develop a solution that will show the .NET skills of the candidate.    The candidate should focus on quality solution instead of dealing with UI and UX. Feel               free to introduce design patterns if applicable. Unit tests will be considered as an              advantage.    You are also allowed to use any internet sources and libraries, unless they solve the               assignment entirely.       Task The task is to consume data from API. You should store it and provide output as a list of                   employees. This list should show the employee's details. Don't worry too much about             the design - it is the .NET we are interested in.
